# DataReporter WebCare CMP

This template installs the DataReporter WebCare CMP in your Google Tag Manager
instance.

You need a valid license key from DataReporter WebCare to activate the banner. This 
key looks like:

```

You'll find this key in the integration section of your WebCare license.

Google Consent Mode v2 is automatically supported by WebCare CMP.


# Installation

copy your license key into the "WebCare CMP Id" field and you are ready to go.
